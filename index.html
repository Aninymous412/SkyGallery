                  Learn about the different types of clouds you might see in the sky in the Ten Basic Cloud Types Gallery. The cloud types have been organized into three categories based
                  on their height: high-level clouds, mid-level clouds, and low-level clouds. In the high-level clouds category, you'll find the feathery cirrus clouds and the thin
                  and veil-like cirrostratus clouds. The mid-level clouds category includes clouds like altostratus and altocumulus, which tend to have a more uniform and layered appearance.
                  Finally, the low-level clouds category includes the easily recognized fluffy cumulus clouds and the spread-out stratocumulus clouds. These image galleries and descriptions
                  will guide you through the key features of each cloud type, making it easy for you to identify and differentiate between them. Understanding cloud types can also help you
                  predict weather patterns, so start browsing the Ten Basic Cloud Types Gallery today!
